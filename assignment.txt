Letâ€™s create a Python program that generates a personalized birthday card. The program will prompt the user for specific pieces of information, and then generate a birthday card based on their inputs. The age of the person should be calculated based on the year of birth provided by the user.

1. Write a program that prompts the user for the following pieces of information:
  - Recipient's name
  - Year of birth
  - Personalized message
  - Sender's name

2. The program should then calculate the age of the recipient based on the current year and the year of birth provided.

3. Generate a personalized birthday card with the following message:

[Recipient's Name], let's celebrate your [Age] years of awesomeness!
Wishing you a day filled with joy and laughter as you turn [Age]!

[Short Personalized Message]

With love and best wishes,
[Sender's Name]

Hints:

- Make sure that the program is easy to use. Display messages when asking users for data.
- You'll need to perform a calculation to determine the recipient's age. Remember to convert input from user to a proper variable type.
- Make sure your output follows the provided format. However, you can modify the template to your liking, just make sure to display all necessary variables.
